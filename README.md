# Node-Based Pipeline Editor

This project is a frontend technical assessment that demonstrates a node-based pipeline editor built using React and React Flow.

## 🚀 Features
- Drag-and-drop pipeline editor
- Multiple node types: Input, Text, LLM, Output
- Reusable BaseNode abstraction for consistent UI
- Clean and scalable component architecture
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## 🧠 Key Concept
The core focus of this project is **node abstraction**.  
A reusable `BaseNode` component is used to standardize layout and styling across all node types, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
